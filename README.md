# Outlier_Detection_and_Removal
  
The raw nature of real-world data necessitates refining and organizing to render it suitable for analysis. Data cleaning stands as a crucial precursor to tackling practical data science tasks.  
Therefore, in this work, we will focus on outliers. We will distinguish between different types of outliers and explore methods for detecting and removing them. Specifically, we are using the **Interquartile Range Method, the Standard Deviation Method and the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (two approaches).**  
Subsequently, we will apply various scaling techniques such as the **StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler and the RobustScaler.**  
Our model of choice is **linear regression.**  
  
For this purpose, the **insurance dataset** will serve as the basis for our analysis.
  
The dataset used in this repository was created by Bob Wakefield and is hosted on Kaggle.
